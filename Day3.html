        alt="URL Structure" height="200">
    <p>It is the address used to access the resource address.The structure of url is divided to three classes those are
    <ol>
        <li>Protocol</li>
        <li>Domain</li>
        <li>Path</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><u>1.Protocol:</u></h3>It is the set guidelines or rules helps us to display the data over the internet.There
    are
    different types in protocol mainly
    <ul>
        <li>http</li>
        <li>https</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>2.Domain:</u></h3>Domain make it easy for users to access websites without needing to remember IP
    addresses.There
    are two types in Domain
    <ul>
        <li>Second Level Domain</li>
        <li>Top Level Domain</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>3.Path:</u></h3>The Path specifies the location of the resource on the server.

    <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
    <p>Agile Methodology is one most used method in developing of a project.
        It uses Sprint Method in division work to the developers like sprint1,sprint2..etc.for every sprint they will
        provide a time period.After every sprint the code is sent to the testing team,if testing team accept the code
        then it
        moves for sprint 2,else it sent to sprint1.There is a <b>Scrum Call</b>
        during the project,they will track the sprint details,clarify the developer queries and gives some
        instructions.The Scrum call is Managed by <b>Scrum Master.</b>The specialisation of this
        method is testing is done after every sprint unlike other methods that improves
        efficiency of the system.
    </p>
    <h2>Waterfall Methodology</h2>
    <p>It is one of the project implementation method mostly opted for Smaller Projects.In this method the testing is
        done
        after the completion whole development.It is mostly used method followed by agile.</p>
    <h2>SDLC(Software development Life Cycle):</h2>

    <p>Software Development Life cycle is the process for Developing project.It consist several steps <br>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Requirement Analysis:</b>Identify and document the requirements.clients define project
            goals,scope.</li>
        <li><b>Planning:</b>Plan for resources and analyse the budget.</li>
        <li><b>Designing:</b>Create architecture and Design features of the system.</li>
        <li><b>Implementation:</b>Developers write the code according to the design specifications.</li>
        <li><b>Testing:</b>The software is tested to find bugs and also the user acceptance.</li>
        <li><b>Deployment:</b>The system is made available for users.</li>
        <li><b>Maintainance:</b>The system is monitored after the Deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Devops</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Devops team will secure data Deployment through CI/CD Pipelines.</li>
        <li>They will adjust the storage Requirement by upscaling and downscaling.</li>
        <li>They ensure Maintainance of the project after development.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
